 * Once a thread makes the state transition from the new state to the runnable state,you can think of the
 * thread having TWO states at the OS level. The ready state and running state.
 * 
 * A thread is in the ready state when it is waiting for the OS to run it in the processor time.
 * The current thread may end up taking lots of time and finally may give up the CPU voluntarily.
 * In that case, the thread goes back to the ready state.
